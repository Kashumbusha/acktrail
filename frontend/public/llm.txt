**Q: Can I change plans?**
A: Yes, upgrade or downgrade anytime. Changes are prorated immediately.

**Q: What happens after trial expires?**
A: You'll need to subscribe to continue accessing features. All data is preserved.

**Q: Is SSO required?**
A: No, SSO is an optional add-on. Email authentication works for all users by default.

**Q: How are guest invites counted?**
A: Each unique email address that receives a policy as a guest counts toward your monthly quota. Guests don't need accounts or logins.

**Q: What file formats are supported?**
A: Markdown text (rich text editor) and PDF uploads for policy documents.

A: Enterprise white-labeling is on the roadmap. Contact us for early access.
